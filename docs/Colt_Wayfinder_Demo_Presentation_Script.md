# Colt Wayfinder Tool - Demo Presentation Script

## Introduction (2 minutes)

"Thank you for the opportunity to present today. I'm excited to share with you a concept we've developed specifically for Colt – an intelligent wayfinder tool that will transform how your customers discover and select your smoke control, ventilation, and climate control solutions.

As pioneers in your industry since 1931, Colt has always been at the forefront of innovation in smoke control and ventilation technology. Today, I'll demonstrate how we can bring that same innovation to your digital customer experience.

The challenge we're addressing is one I'm sure you recognize: your products are highly technical, with specific applications across various industries and building types. For customers, navigating this complexity can be overwhelming, potentially leading to missed opportunities for both them and Colt.

Our solution is the Colt Wayfinder – an intelligent, guided approach to product discovery that matches your customers with the perfect Colt solution for their specific needs."

## Demo Walkthrough (8 minutes)

### Landing Page

"This is the Colt Wayfinder tool. As you can see, we've designed it to be clean, intuitive, and aligned with your brand identity. The hero section immediately communicates the value proposition: 'Find the Perfect Colt Solution for Your Building.'

Customers have two primary pathways: they can start a guided search process, which we'll look at in a moment, or they can browse products directly if they already know what they're looking for."

### Scenario 1: Building Manager Seeking Smoke Control Solutions

"Let's walk through a common scenario. Imagine a building manager responsible for a new office building who needs a smoke control solution but isn't sure which products are right for their situation.

They would click 'Start Guided Search,' and then the wayfinder begins a simple, step-by-step process.

First, they select their industry – in this case, 'Commercial Real Estate.'

Next, they identify their specific problem: 'Smoke Control.'

Finally, they specify their building type: 'Office Building.'

Based on these inputs, the wayfinder now presents curated recommendations specifically for office building smoke control within commercial real estate. Notice how each result is tagged with a recommendation type, clearly distinguishing between solutions, products, and resources.

Let's look at the top recommendation, 'Smoke Control for Commercial Buildings.' This comprehensive solution addresses exactly what our building manager needs. We can see industry tags, a detailed description, and even related products.

If I click 'Show More,' we reveal additional details, including technical specifications and related items that might also be relevant to their project.

Every recommendation includes a direct link to the relevant page on your website, creating a seamless path to deeper information or to initiate contact with your sales team."

### Scenario 2: Technical Search Capability

"In addition to the guided experience, sometimes users know exactly what they're looking for or have specific technical requirements in mind. The Wayfinder includes a powerful search function that handles this case.

Let's say a HVAC contractor is looking for information about 'exhaust fans' for a project. I'll type that into the search bar...

As you can see, the search instantly returns relevant results, prioritizing the most suitable options based on the query. The Industrial Exhaust Fan Series 500 appears at the top, with all key specifications and categorization clearly visible.

This search function uses advanced semantic search technology, meaning it understands concepts, not just keywords. So searching for 'air movement systems' would still bring up fans and ventilators, even if those exact words weren't used."

### Scenario 3: Product Comparisons and Related Content

"Another powerful feature is the ability to explore related content. When viewing a specific product like the SkyLite Natural Ventilator, clicking 'Show More' reveals not only detailed specifications but also related solutions, companion products, and relevant technical documentation.

This creates a web of connections that helps customers understand the complete Colt ecosystem of solutions, encouraging them to explore complementary products they might not have initially considered."

## Modern Implementation Approach (3 minutes)

"For implementation, we're proposing a modern, hybrid approach that combines the best of AI technology with strategic human expertise:

**Our Hybrid AI-Augmented Model includes:**

- AI-powered platforms for rapid development and intelligent functionality
- Strategic use of traditional development expertise for complex components
- Design specialists ensuring optimal user experience
- Industry experts validating technical accuracy and domain-specific needs

This approach delivers three key advantages over traditional implementation methods:

1. **Faster Time-to-Market**: We can deliver the full solution in 16 weeks, compared to 30+ weeks with traditional approaches.

2. **Cost Optimization**: Our hybrid model reduces overall costs while ensuring quality where it matters most.

3. **Future-Ready Architecture**: The solution is built to evolve and improve over time, without requiring major redevelopment.

The implementation would follow a 3-phase approach:

**Phase 1 (5 weeks)**: Core wayfinder functionality with limited product set

## Q&A Preparation

**Q: How much of this relies on AI versus traditional development?**  
A: We've designed a balanced hybrid approach. While we leverage AI for content enhancement, intelligent search, and rapid development, we strategically use traditional development expertise for complex functionality, integrations, and critical components. This gives us the best of both worlds – speed and innovation from AI, reliability and expertise from traditional methods.

**Q: What resources would we need to provide from our side?**  
A: We've designed this to minimize demands on your team. We would need input from your product specialists to validate the recommendation logic and technical details, access to your product database for integration, and periodic reviews from key stakeholders. The implementation team handles all technical development, content preparation, and deployment.

**Q: How would this integrate with our existing website?**  
A: There are several integration options. The wayfinder could be embedded into your existing site, deployed as a standalone tool with your branding, or we could rebuild specific sections of your site to incorporate this functionality seamlessly. We'd recommend a technical discovery phase to identify the best approach for your specific infrastructure.

**Q: What ongoing maintenance would this require?**  
A: The hybrid model includes ongoing support with approximately 5 days per month of expert time for updates and enhancements. The AI components largely maintain themselves, with the platform licensing including regular updates and improvements. We can provide various levels of managed service options depending on your preference.

**Q: How do you ensure accurate technical information?**  
A: This is where the hybrid approach really shines. While AI helps with content structure and presentation, we incorporate industry expert review at critical stages to validate technical accuracy, terminology, and product relationships. We never rely solely on AI for technical specifications or critical product information.
