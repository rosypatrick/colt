Certified according to EN 12101-2 and VdS-approved, Apollo ATI is a natural smoke and heat extraction ventilator which is primarily used in industrial, commercial and municipal buildings.
Side dampers are integrated into the Apollo ATI body which can be opened for rain-proof day-to-day ventilation. Aerodynamically shaped vanes prevent the penetration of rainwater, while at the same time allowing ventilation, while side profiles direct this water away from the ventilator onto the roof.

Side dampers and wind deflectors provide aerodynamically efficient ventilation in bad weather
