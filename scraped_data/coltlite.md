**Category:** Smoke Control

## Description

Natural louvred glazed vent, suitable for natural and smoke ventilation. Its form and function makes it particularly suited to naturally ventilated buildings where good aerodynamic and measured free area ventilation is required while achieving high acoustic, thermal and aerodynamic performance. Whilst it is primarily designed as a glazed element of the building envelope, it can also be applied as a high specification fire, smoke and air control damper.

Most variants conform to both EN 12101-2 as smoke ventilators; all models conform to EN 14351-1 as natural ventilators

Inlet and extract ventilation as well as the entry of natural daylight for most industrial and commercial buildings

Achieves high acoustic, thermal and aerodynamic performance

Suited for installation into the facade

Durable: manufactured from tough, corrosion resistant aluminium alloy, with stainless steel fixings

Manufactured under the ISO 9000 quality standard

Natural louvred ventilator designed for automatic smoke extraction

The WCO ventilates and illuminates industrial and commercial buildings.
