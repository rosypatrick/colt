# Jetstream

**Category:** Smoke Control

## Description

Jetstream is an impulse fan designed for the ventilation of car parks and underground service areas, so as both to reduce levels of polluted air and to extract smoke in the event of a fire. The fans use tunnel ventilation technology to eliminate the need for costly and bulky ductwork. Compared to ductwork systems, this may save car-parking spaces, reduce running costs and noise, and make the car park a lighter, less cluttered environment.

Two non-flanged and three flanged versions to choose from, both unidirectional and reversible.

The fan is suitable for either two speed or variable speed operation, depending on the application.

Tested and certified to EN 12101-3 in accredited third party test laboratories and is UKCA & CE marked.

Manufactured from hot dipped galvanized casing with the option of a polyester powder coating to any RAL colour.

Manufactured to the ISO 9001 quality standard.

Low maintenance as there is no ducting to clean.
